# Projet-Preparation-metier-P2M-
Creating an intelligent model which can predict the quantities of emissions of greenhouse gas.
We used for the prediction:
  -Linear Regression
  -SVM
  -DecisionTreeRegressor
To replace the numerical missing values we used and compared 3 approches:
  -Linear Interpolation
  -Dropping
  -Mean values
To replace the categorical missing values we used the method of the most frequent value. 
I had uploaded also the final report of the full project.
